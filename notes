- Authors can sign up and log in
  - we will always either have a logged in user (Author) or no one will be logged in
- Authors can create their own articles
- Anyone can read anyone's articles
- Only the owner of an article can edit or delete that article

What is Auth????????

It's two things:

  AUTHENTICATION - the user is who they say they are.  I need a unique identifier, most commonly email or username

  AUTHORIZATION - once we know who the user is, are they allowed to be doing the thing they're trying to do


Tools we need:

- add username and password to the Author (which is our user model)
- we don't want to store raw strings as passwords in the database
  - we need encryption
  - we will use the bcrypt gem!

- Then we need the ability to allow someone to __sign up__
- Then we need the ability to allow someone to __login__
- Then we need the ability to allow someone to __logout__

^^ the above probably should involve adding another controller
- we will need to use a tool that comes from Rack & Sinatra - session

- the session hash (really an object) becomes available in the controllers
- it persists throughout our use of any site that has session enabled
